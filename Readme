For the assignment, I've attempted to implement the feature that would create a file to write the location updates to and read them. Unfornutately that is as far as I could go. There were a lot of obstacles that couldn't be overlooked. 

The most frustrating part of this was creating the file. The developer pages didn't describe where the location of the file was. 
After snooping around with google, I found that the file would be created under a private folder on my phone and I can't have access to it unless I root the device, which I don't want to. 

I tried to find out what the filepath was for the files I've made but it's quite soon till the deadline so I'm calling it quits.
